This is a sample application used to illustrate how to use chef-solo and bundler and vagrant.

It installs a sinatra-powered iphone mirror of http://news.ycombinator.com.  Uses REE and Unicorn.

Instructions for getting this installed on your machine.  Tested on OS X 10.6. Probably works on other OSs, let me know.


1.  Install Virtual Box.  http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Checkout source code to project
git clone git://github.com/joevandyk/fixienews.git

3. Install vagrant gem and download Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid)
gem install vagrant
vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box

4. Start the vagrant box, runs chef-solo, starts up the services
vagrant up

And that's it!  Go to http://192.168.10.35:8080 to view it.  Preferably with an iPhone.

The key files to look at:
Vagrantfile
config/cookbooks/vagrant_main/recipes/default.rb

You can now edit the recipe file and run "vagrant provision" in the root project directory, and you can see how the cookbooks will run.

The gems (nokogiri, rack, unicorn, sinatra) have been bundled in the vendor directory via bundler 1.0.  No installation of the gems is necessary on the VM -- the only gem that's necessary to install is bundler (and it's installed via chef).
